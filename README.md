Getting Started
You can download the code files directly from this repository or clone it to your local machine using Git. Once you have the code, you can simply open the HTML file in your web browser to see the loading animation.

How it Works
The loading animation is created using CSS keyframes to rotate a circular element continuously. The HTML file simply contains a div element with a class of loading, which is styled using the CSS rules in style.css.

Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the loading animation by modifying the CSS rules in style.css. For example, you can change the size and color of the circular element, adjust the animation duration and timing, or add additional animations and effects.
